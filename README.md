# Battleship Game 

This is a console-based implementation of the classic Battleship game, written in C# as my first OOP project.

# Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone or download the repository and open the solution file in Visual Studio (or another IDE of your choice). You can then build and run the project from within the IDE.
Alternatively, you can navigate to the bin/Debug folder and run the Battleship.exe file directly from the command line.

# Gameplay

The game is played on a 10x10(or whatever you want,depends on your input) grid, with each player placing their ships on the board before taking turns to guess the location of their opponent's ships. The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.

# Project Structure

The project is organized into several classes, each representing a different component of the game. These include:

### Board:
Represents the game board and contains methods for placing ships and making guesses.
### Ship:
Represents a single ship on the board, with properties for its length and position.
### Player:
Represents a single player in the game, with methods for placing ships and making guesses.
### Game:
Controls the flow of the game, including initializing the players and the board, and managing turns.
